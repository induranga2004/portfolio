```

## Template Variables

The contact form sends these variables to EmailJS:
- `from_name` - Sender's name

- `message` - The message content
- `to_name` - Your name (Induranga Gunasekara)

5. Check for success/error messages
6. Verify email delivery in your inbox

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"Failed to send message"** - Check your internet connection and EmailJS credentials

3. **Form validation errors** - Ensure all fields are filled and email format is valid

### Debug Steps:
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for error messages
3. Verify EmailJS credentials are correct
4. Test with a simple message first

## Production Deployment

The contact form will work on any hosting platform since it's frontend-only:

No server configuration needed!

## Security Notes
